Karen Gibson not only rocks in her RENTCafe knowledge, but in her generosity in sharing that with clients AND teammates! She saved this particular teammate while I wasn't feeling up to snuff and jumped in LAST min to help on a client call. What awesome teamwork and care!! - Jill Hargrove     •     Big Kudos to Jeannie! No matter what topics might pop up, you are always there to lend a hand. Thank you for being such a good teacher! - Christine Palmer     •     Shout out to Vera Morris, for coming to the student team, and jumping right in on several client calls and implementation cases, like she has been here since day one, a great asset to the team. - Angela Black     •     A big kudos to Janine De Leon for writing an excellent KB about how to update the portal themes to match RENTCaffeine websites!     •
